# CryptoClustering
module 19 challenge 
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.
Use the elbow method to find the best value for k
Use the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data
sing the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.

Retrieve the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component and then answer the following question in your notebook:
